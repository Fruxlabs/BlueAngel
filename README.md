BlueAngel : The improved "Ransomware" Simulator
==================
Based on cashcat, this is an improvement over it and intends to make it a bit more sophisticated.

## VERY IMPORTANT NOTE
THIS IS **NOT** A REAL RANSOMWARE! IT LITERALLY DOES NOT MATCH ANY REAL DEFINITION OF RANSOMWARE! 
ALL IT DOES IS RENAME files with the extension of .TXT to .LOCKY to test file activity monitoring tools. Nothing gets Encrypted!

## Requirements
+ Tested on Windows 7, 10, Server 2012R2, 2016+ 
+ Requires at least .NET 4.6.1

## TO DO
+ Add network discovery capabilities
+ Network propagation
